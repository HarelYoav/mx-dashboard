# Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project for me was to learn how to integret all the parts of web development
After I finished a online course on udemy, 
I found my self with the knowledge how to develop using node.js, react, javaSript, html, css and more
But with out the knowledge how to connect them all together to a single project

This project was created using Mern stack: MongoDB, Express, React with redux and Node.js

In this project I used MongoDb to store the user data and notes data
There is a use in OpenWeather Api for the forecast
And used in geolocation to get the user current location (if the user declined to give the location the website get the location from the user ip)
And used react for the frontend  and with redux to managing the state


# MX-dashboard

Get the weather in your location and around you, write notes and share them with other users if you liked too
